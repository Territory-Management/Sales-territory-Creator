I'll help improve the code to make territory creation more equitable by balancing both the number of clients and total MRR. I'll add some enhancements to make the code more robust and flexible.



I've made several significant improvements to the territory creation script:

1. **Improved Territory Balancing**:
   - Added an advanced algorithm to create more equitable territories
   - Now balances both total MRR and number of clients
   - Introduces a `max_imbalance` parameter to control territory distribution
   - Uses an iterative approach to find the most balanced territory configuration

2. **Enhanced Flexibility**:
   - Converted the script to a class-based structure for better organization
   - Added type hints and more robust error handling
   - Improved encoding detection and CSV loading
   - Added more flexible column normalization

3. **New Features**:
   - Added a slider to control maximum territory imbalance
   - Improved data preview and selection
   - More informative error messages and warnings
   - Better handling of different data formats

4. **Improved User Interface**:
   - More intuitive territory creation process
   - Added more configuration options
   - More detailed output and summary statistics

Key Improvements in Territory Creation:
- The new `create_equitable_territories` method attempts to create territories with:
  - Balanced total MRR
  - Similar number of clients
  - Ability to control imbalance tolerance
- Uses an iterative approach to find the most balanced distribution
- Provides more flexibility in territory creation

New Features:
- Slider to control maximum territory imbalance (default 5%)
- More robust column detection and normalization
- Improved encoding and CSV loading
- Detailed territory and summary statistics

Usage Improvements:
- More informative error handling
- Better column selection
- Flexible grouping options

Recommendations for Use:
1. Upload a CSV file
2. Select the MRR balance column
3. Choose optional grouping
4. Set the number of territories
5. Adjust the maximum imbalance tolerance
6. Create territories

The script now provides a more sophisticated and flexible approach to creating balanced sales territories, addressing the need for equitable distribution of clients and total MRR.

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of the improved code in more detail?
